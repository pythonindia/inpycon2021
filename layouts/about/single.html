                    What is PyCon India ?

                </h1>

                <p class="text-grey">PyCon India is the largest annual gathering of Python aficionados and experts

                    in India where Pythonistas come from around the world to celebrate their use of Python, and

                    share their knowledge and experience. It is a volunteer-driven conference aimed to foster the

                    adoption, use, and development of the Python programming language. The 12th edition of PyCon was

                    supposed to take place in the beautiful city of Bangalore. But due to the current situation, the

                    conference will take place virtually from 2nd October to 5th October 2020. With this move, this

                    year, we are making the conference bigger, better, and more accessible to Pythonistas all over

                    the world. </p>

                    with Devsprints). On the workshop day, people can attend hands-on workshops, and learn about a

                      With PyCon India 2020 being online this year, we are introducing preview videos re our proposal

                      submission workflow. Preview videos are you talking about your proposal, topics you intend to

                      cover in the talk, and how you intend to cover them. Participants are strongly suggested to

                      upload links of their preview videos while submitting their proposals. It will be immensely

                      helpful for reviewers to go through preview videos and take that into account before making

                      final decisions on your talk proposal. You can check out our <a href="#"

                  <p class="text-grey pt-3">

                      PyCon India is organized every year by Python communities and user groups all across India as a

                      way to pool their experience and expertise into making a more successful, more accessible

                      conference every year. The conference is organized entirely by volunteers all the way from

                      planning, to finding the speakers, to managing the event successfully. We have a very large

                      distributed team of enthusiastic and experienced volunteers coming from various Python

                      communities all across India. </p>



                  <p class="text-grey pt-3">

                      Our Vision is to bring the cumulative knowledge and experience of our community members to the

                      public. We want to create a responsible and inclusive ecosystem where Pythonistas from diverse

                      backgrounds can come together to share their stories and gain something from other's

                      experiences. </p>



                  <p class="text-grey pt-3">The Python programming language has become an essential tool for people

                      from various backgrounds and careers, including programmers, mathematicians, doctors,

                      scientists, security researchers, hardware designers, and many more. We aim to ensure the

                      conference can reflect the diversity of our community and facilitate the exchange of ideas,

                      knowledge, and experiences enriching the community. </p>



                  <p class="text-grey pt-3">

                      We would also like to ensure that the conference approaches everyone with respect, is accessible

                      to everyone no matter their situation, and that we resolve differences peacefully in case of

                      conflicts. You can also help with that by reading our and following it .
