              <p class="text-grey pt-4">PyCon India is the largest gathering of Pythonistas in India for the
                  Python programming language. The 13th edition of PyCon India will be taking place online from
                  17th September to 20th September 2021. With this unique scenario at hand, we plan to make this
                  year's conference bigger, better, and more accessible to Pythonistas all across the world who
                  can watch, participate and share their views right from the comfort of their homes. </p>
